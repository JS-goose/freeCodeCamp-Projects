## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

None

## Deployment

If you wish to use this site you'll need to change out some of the images and information.  However, I am fine with that as long as you give credit.  

Simply fork the repo or download it to your local machine.  Open `index.html` and begin making your changes for deployment.  Once you're finished, check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for some ***free*** hosting
