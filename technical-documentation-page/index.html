            Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made
            available in programming languages to allow developers to create
            complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code
            away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your
            house, apartment, or other dwellings. If you want to use an
            appliance in your house, you simply plug it into a plug socket and
            it works. You don't try to wire it directly into the power supply —
            to do so would be really inefficient and, if you are not an
            electrician, difficult and dangerous to attempt.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the same way, if you want to say, program some 3D graphics, it is
            a lot easier to do it using an API written in a higher level
            language such as JavaScript or Python, rather than try to directly
            write low level code (say C or C++) that directly controls the
            computer's GPU or other graphics functions.

          <header class="content-titles">What Can APIs Do?</header>
          <p>
            There are a huge number of APIs available in modern browsers that
            allow you to do a wide variety of things in your code. You can see
            this by taking a look at the
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API"
              target="_blank"

          <h3 class="content-subtitles">
            <span class="content-subtitle-span">Common browser APIs</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            In particular, the most common categories of browser APIs you'll use
            (and which we'll cover in this module in greater detail) are:
          </p>
          <ul id="common-browser-apis" class="lists">
            <li>
              <span class="api-list-span">APIs for manipulating documents</span>
              loaded into the browser. The most obvious example is the DOM
              (Document Object Model) API, which allows you to manipulate HTML
              and CSS — creating, removing and changing HTML, dynamically
              applying new styles to your page, etc. Every time you see a popup
              window appear on a page, or some new content displayed, for
              example, that's the DOM in action. Find out more about these types
              of API in Manipulating documents.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="api-list-span"
                >APIs that fetch data from the server</span
              >
              to update small sections of a webpage on their own are very
              commonly used. This seemingly small detail has had a huge impact
              on the performance and behaviour of sites — if you just need to
              update a stock listing or list of available new stories, doing it
              instantly without having to reload the whole entire page from the
              server can make the site or app feel much more responsive and
              "snappy". APIs that make this possible include XMLHttpRequest and
              the Fetch API. You may also come across the term Ajax, which
              describes this technique. Find out more about such APIs in
              Fetching data from the server.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="api-list-span"
                >APIs for drawing and manipulating graphics</span
              >
              are now widely supported in browsers — the most popular ones are
              Canvas and WebGL, which allow you to programmatically update the
              pixel data contained in an HTML <em>canvas</em> element to create
              2D and 3D scenes. For example, you might draw shapes such as
              rectangles or circles, import an image onto the canvas, and apply
              a filter to it such as sepia or grayscale using the Canvas API, or
              create a complex 3D scene with lighting and textures using WebGL.
              Such APIs are often combined with APIs for creating animation
              loops (such as window.requestAnimationFrame()) and others to make
              constantly updating scenes like cartoons and games.
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="api-list-span">Audio and Video APIs</span> like
              HTMLMediaElement, the Web Audio API, and WebRTC allow you to do
              really interesting things with multimedia such as creating custom
              UI controls for playing audio and video, displaying text tracks
              like captions and subtitles along with your videos, grabbing video
              from your web camera to be manipulated via a canvas (see above) or
              displayed on someone else's computer in a web conference, or
              adding effects to audio tracks (such as gain, distortion, panning,
              etc).
            </li>

            <li>
              <span class="api-list-span">Device APIs</span> are basically APIs
              for manipulating and retrieving data from modern device hardware
              in a way that is useful for web apps. We've already talked about
              the Geolocation API accessing the device's location data so you
              can plot your position on a map. Other examples include telling
              the user that a useful update is available on a web app via system
              notifications (see the Notifications API) or vibration hardware
              (see the Vibration API).

              <span class="api-list-span">Client-side storage APIs</span> are
              becoming a lot more widespread in web browsers — the ability to
              store data on the client-side is very useful if you want to create
              an app that will save its state between page loads, and perhaps
              even work when the device is offline. There are a number of
              options available, e.g. simple name/value storage with the Web
              Storage API, and more complex tabular data storage with the
              IndexedDB API.

        <article id="apis-work">
          <header class="content-titles">How Do APIs Work?</header>
          <p>
            Different JavaScript APIs work in slightly different ways, but
            generally, they have common features and similar themes to how they
            work.
          </p>
        
          <h3 class="content-subtitles">
            <span class="content-subtitle-span">They are based on objects</span>
          </h3>
        
          <p>
            Your code interacts with APIs using one or more JavaScript objects,
            which serve as containers for the data the API uses (contained in
            object properties), and the functionality the API makes available
            (contained in object methods).
          </p>
        
          <p>
            Let's return to the example of the Geolocation API — this is a very
            simple API that consists of a few simple objects:
            <ul class="lists">
              <li>Geolocation, which contains three methods for controlling the retrieval of geodata.</li>
        
              <li>Position, which represents the position of a device at a given time
                — this contains a Coordinates object that contains the actual
                position information, plus a timestamp representing the given time.</li>
        
              <li>Coordinates, which contains a whole lot of useful data on the device
                position, including latitude and longitude, altitude, velocity and
                direction of movement, and more.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>So how do these objects interact?
            If you look at our maps-example.html example (see it live also),
            you'll see the following code:<br>
            <div class="code-container">
              <code class="code-example">navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
              var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(position.coords.latitude,position.coords.longitude);
              var myOptions = {
                zoom: 8,
                center: latlng,
                mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.TERRAIN,
                disableDefaultUI: true
              }
              var map = new google.maps.Map(document.querySelector("#map_canvas"), myOptions);
            });
            </code>
