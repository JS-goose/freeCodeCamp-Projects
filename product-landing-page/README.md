### fCC Product Landing Page

This is the tribute page I built as part of the ***Responsive Web Design Projects*** in freeCodeCamp cirriculum.  It is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.

It was built with: 

* HTML
* CSS (Grid and Flexbox)

No external libraries/frameworks were used, I coded everything manually.

Here is a [live preview of the landing page](https://codepen.io/JS-goose/full/aQZONR/)
